#  Image Classification

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 2**

In this project we had to build and run a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and use it to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The project was writen in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-image-classification/blob/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_, _pickle_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment.
